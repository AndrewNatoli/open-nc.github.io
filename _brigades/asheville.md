The [Code for Asheville](http://www.codeforasheville.org/) brigade is a volunteer civic technology organization, one of the first of over 80 local chapters of Code for America. We mobilize a network of talented, civic-minded individuals who bring technology and data know-how to help communities and local governments work better. We facilitate data-driven conversations about community issues, advocate for transparency and access to open data, and help create tools to address community problems.
