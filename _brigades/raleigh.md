The Open Raleigh Brigade believes government can work for the people, by the people in the 21st century. We are a volunteer organization advocating for open government, open data, and open innovation. We believe civic tech is a great way to impact our community.

Open Raleigh Brigade is building an awesome civic tech community by [hosting meet-ups](https://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Code-for-America/) and [NC Open Pass events](http://ncopenpass.com). (Note, we share a meet-up group with Code for Cary and Code for Durham.)

Our primary focus is planning [NC Open Pass](http://ncopenpass.com)&mdash;an event series focused on improving our communities using open innovation and open data with neighbors and government partners. Our premier events are Civic Camp, held in September, and DataPalooza, our open data competition and hackathon that starts in September and concludes in early November.

Open Raleigh Brigade is proud to partner and collaborate with the City of Raleigh and Wake County. 

If you'd like to get involved, join our [meet-up group, Code for Triangle](https://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Code-for-America/) or connect with brigade captains [Jason Hibbets](https://twitter.com/jhibbets) and [Chris Mathew](https://twitter.com/christhedba).
