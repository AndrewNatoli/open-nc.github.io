# CodeForPittsburgh.github.io: Code For Pittsburgh Github pages repository. 

For now http://CodeForPittsburgh.github.io. redirects to http://codeforpittsburgh.openpittsburghbrigade.org. 

Folders in this repository can used for quickly serving up pages for projects, tests, or whatever - as long as there is an `index.html` in the folder, it will be served up. For example: http://CodeForPittsburgh.github.io/fishfrymap.
