## Purpose

Accessible, accurate and safe information on resources for those returning to the community after a period of incarceration or suffering the consequences of a criminal conviction on their record can be very hard to come by. Not only is the information dispersed across many different sites, but there is a tremendous amount of inaccurate, outdated information out there and a lot of places that are looking to exploit the vulnerable. The challenge is there not only for those contending with the issue, but also for those trying to help them: defense lawyers, parole officers, prison counselors, etc.

We built the [Buncombe Reentry Resources Hub](http://www.buncombereentryhub.org/) to provide up-to-date, accurate and safe links to national, state and local information and resources. The site is in use by the defense bar, DA's office, prison officials and reentering individuals. Now we are working to scale this resource to every county in North Carolina.

## Project Status

There are 2 main components to the project: the public site and an administration tool to let content administrators add and modify information. 

Development of the public site is nearly complete (expected launch: late spring/early summer 2018). Development of the administrative functionality will begin soon. Further information on the project and ways to contribute may be found in the [Reentry Resources Hub repository](https://github.com/Open-NC/reentry-resources-hub).
