**Open NC Collabrative**, North Carolina's [Code for America Brigade](https://www.codeforamerica.org/), working to leverage our skills and interests to serve the people of our state. We hope to create a new model of civic tech that weaves the individual existing organizations together into a more powerful network that better serves our whole state.
